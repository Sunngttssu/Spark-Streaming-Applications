# Spark Streaming Applications

## Overview

The Spark Streaming Applications repository contains implementations of real-time data processing applications using Apache Spark Streaming. These applications are designed to process and analyze streaming data efficiently, making them suitable for handling real-time analytics, monitoring, and big data processing tasks.

## Features

* Real-time Data Processing: Leverages Apache Spark Streaming for handling continuous data streams.

* Scalability & Fault Tolerance: Built to scale across distributed environments while ensuring reliability.

* Multiple Data Sources: Supports data ingestion from Kafka, Flume, socket streams, and more.

* Transformations & Aggregations: Implements windowing, stateful transformations, and real-time aggregations.

* Integration with Big Data Ecosystem: Compatible with Hadoop, Hive, HDFS, and cloud storage solutions.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Apache Spark (2.x or 3.x)

* Java 8+

* Scala (if using Spark with Scala API)

* Kafka / Flume (if applicable)

## Steps

1. Clone the repository:

### git clone https://github.com/Sunngttssu/Spark-Streaming-Applications.git
    cd Spark-Streaming-Applications

2. Build the project (if using Scala and SBT):

### sbt clean package

3. Run a Spark Streaming application:

### spark-submit --class <MainClass> --master <spark-master-url> path-to-jar

## Supported Applications

* Log Stream Processing: Real-time monitoring and analytics of log data.

* Stock Market Analysis: Ingests stock price data and provides real-time trends.

* Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Processes live tweets and performs sentiment analysis.

* IoT Sensor Data Processing: Captures and analyzes sensor data from IoT devices.

## Technology Stack

* Apache Spark Streaming

* Kafka / Flume (for data ingestion)

* Scala / Python

* Hadoop, Hive, HDFS (optional for storage)

* Elasticsearch / Cassandra (optional for storage and search)
